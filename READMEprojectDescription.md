For this Homework #3 project, we created a password generator using arrays and loops. The objective was to generate a random password based on five user inputs: password length, upper case letters, lower case letters, special symbols, and numbers. I created a do/while loop that prompts the user to enter a password length between 8 and 128 characters. When the value is entered, an alert confirms that the user has entered a valid number of characters. I have created a do/while loop so that the user will continue to be prompted for a valid password length until they do, indeed, enter an appropriate value. 

 When a valid password length is entered, the user will then be prompted to select whether they want other types of characters in their generated password. The alerts will continue to loop if the user does not select any password elements (i.e. clicks 'Cancel' on all alerts -- lower case, upper case, etc.). This loop will only stop if the user selects at least one password characteristic.'

 As password variables are selected, each input will be concatenated into the array. Then, the math.random will select random array elements to generate the new password that satisfies all parameters. The password will then ultimately be displayed on the browswer page. 

 This homework project intended for us to use arrays and loops, but we also learned how to avoid creating infinite loops!
